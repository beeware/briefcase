# install_requirement.py - Install a requirement from a PEP 517 project
#
# Usage
# -----
# $ python install_requirement.py [-h] [--extra EXTRA] [--project-root PROJECT_ROOT] [requirements ...]
#
# Install one or more PEP 517 project defined requirements
#
# positional arguments:
#   requirements          List of project requirements to install. Any project
#                         requirements that start with any of these values will
#                         be installed. For instance, including 'pytest' in this
#                         list would install both pytest and pytest-xdist.
#
# options:
#   -h, --help            show this help message and exit
#   --extra EXTRA         Name of the extra where the requirements are defined
#   --project-root PROJECT_ROOT
#                         File path to the root of the project. The current
#                         directory is used by default.
#
# Purpose
# -------
# Installs one or more requested requirements as defined for the project.
#
# In certain workflows, such as automated coverage reporting, the coverage
# dependencies must be installed first. Since a project's requirements are often
# pinned to specific versions to ensure consistency for the project regardless of the
# environment, the coverage dependencies that are installed should match those pinned
# for the project.
#
# A simple method to accomplish this is ``pip install .[dev]`` in which ``pip`` will
# build the source and install the project with all its defined requirements. However,
# this is very inefficient when only one or a few specific requirements are needed.
#
# Therefore, this script will evaluate the requirements defined in the project's
# metadata and install the ones matching those being requested to be installed.
