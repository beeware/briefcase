## Development Environment

Run `pip install pre-commit` to install pre-commit hooks in to your git hooks.
pre-commit will now run on every commit. Every time you clone a project using
pre-commit running pre-commit install should always be the first thing you do.

If you want to manually run all pre-commit hooks, `pre-commit run --all-files`.
