        Output Streaming Primer
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        What is output streaming?
        -------------------------

        When a command is invoked via ``subprocess.run()``, by default, its
        stdout and stderr are connected directly to the console and the output
        is presented to the user as though the command was invoked natively.
        When output streaming is active, Briefcase reads the command's output
        and prints it in to the console on behalf of the command.

        Why is output streaming necessary?
        ----------------------------------

        Allowing commands to print directly to the console can provide superior
        UX since it allows tools to provide their native experience to users.

        However, a primary mechanism for providing support for Briefcase is
        asking users to provide the log file when errors occur. Often, these
        errors are raised by invoked commands; streaming the output of commands
        allows Briefcase to capture that output and include it in the log file
        as well as the console.

        Additionally, the content of the console can become corrupted if other
        processes print to the console while Rich's dynamic console elements
        such as a Progress Bar are active. Streaming such output allows Rich to
        maintain integrity of all the console content.

        How does output streaming work?
        -------------------------------

        Streaming is activated when:

          1. dynamic content such as the Wait Bar is active and I/O is not
             redirected

          2. the ``stream_output`` argument is ``True`` (as it is by default)

        I/O is considered redirected when both ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` are
        specified (e.g., when ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` are set
        to``subprocess.PIPE`` so the output is available to the caller).

        To facilitate streaming the output, ``stdout`` is set to
        ``subprocess.PIPE``. If ``stderr`` is not specified by calling code,
        then it is set to ``subprocess.STDOUT`` so it is interlaced with stdout
        output.

        The process is created for the command with ``Popen``, and a separate
        thread is started for continuously reading and printing the stdout to
        the console from the command process. It is necessary to read from
        stdout in a thread because the read is uninterruptible; so, a user may
        not be able to abort with CTRL-C.

        When the process ends (or the user sends CTRL-C), a call is made to
        ensure the command process terminates; this, in turn, ensures the thread
        for streaming can properly exit its otherwise infinite loop. The calling
        code is either returned a ``CompletedProcess`` object or
        ``CalledProcessError`` could be raised.

        Output streaming ultimately strives to simulate calling
        ``subprocess.run()`` while proxying the command's output to the console.

        When *not* to use output streaming?
        -----------------------------------

        When streaming is disabled, the command's output **WILL NOT** be
        included the Briefcase log file. This makes troubleshooting difficult
        and should be avoided. However, there are some situations where disabling
        streaming is unavoidable.

        Some commands use their own dynamic console content such as progress
        bars, spinners, and other animations. When such output is streamed, its
        quality can be significantly compromised and look terrible in the
        console for users. If it is not possible to disable such output with
        e.g. a flag for the command, then disabling streaming may be necessary.
        As an example, the ``flatpak install`` command uses many animations.

        If a command requires user input, do not use output streaming. The
        output streaming implementation doesn't provide any facilities to send
        input to the process and doesn't provide any special handling of stdin.
        Additionally, when the command process prompts the user for input, that
        doesn't always trigger ``readline()`` to return; so, the console may
        actually end up waiting for user input before displaying a prompt to the
        user. As an example, accepting Android SDK licenses requires user input.
