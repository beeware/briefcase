        Output Streaming Primer
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        What is output streaming?
        -------------------------

        When a command is invoked via ``subprocess.run()``, by default, its stdout and
        stderr are connected directly to the console and the output is presented to the
        user as though the command was invoked natively. When output streaming is
        active, Briefcase reads the command's output and prints it in to the console on
        behalf of the command.

        Why is output streaming necessary?
        ----------------------------------

        Allowing commands to print directly to the console can provide superior UX since
        it allows tools to provide their native experience to users.

        However, a primary mechanism for providing support for Briefcase is asking users
        to provide the log file when errors occur. Often, these errors are raised by
        invoked commands; streaming the output of commands allows Briefcase to capture
        that output and include it in the log file as well as the console.

        Additionally, the content of the console can become corrupted if other processes
        print to the console while Rich's dynamic console elements such as a Progress
        Bar are active. Streaming such output allows Rich to maintain integrity of all
        the console content.

        How does output streaming work?
        -------------------------------

        Streaming is activated when:

          1. dynamic content such as the Wait Bar is active and I/O is not redirected

          2. the ``stream_output`` argument is ``True`` (as it is by default)

        I/O is considered redirected when both ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` are specified
        (e.g., when ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` are set to``subprocess.PIPE`` so the
        output is available to the caller).

        To facilitate streaming the output, ``stdout`` is set to ``subprocess.PIPE``. If
        ``stderr`` is not specified by calling code, then it is set to
        ``subprocess.STDOUT`` so it is interlaced with stdout output.

        The process is created for the command with ``Popen``, and a separate thread is
        started for continuously reading and printing the stdout to the console from the
        command process. It is necessary to read from stdout in a thread because the
        read is uninterruptible; so, a user may not be able to abort with CTRL-C.

        When the process ends (or the user sends CTRL-C), a call is made to ensure the
        command process terminates; this, in turn, ensures the thread for streaming can
        properly exit its otherwise infinite loop. The calling code is either returned a
        ``CompletedProcess`` object or ``CalledProcessError`` could be raised.

        Output streaming ultimately strives to simulate calling ``subprocess.run()``
        while proxying the command's output to the console.

        When *not* to use output streaming?
        -----------------------------------

        When streaming is disabled, the command's output **WILL NOT** be included the
        Briefcase log file. This makes troubleshooting difficult and should be avoided.
        However, there are some situations where disabling streaming is unavoidable.

        Some commands use their own dynamic console content such as progress bars,
        spinners, and other animations. When such output is streamed, its quality can be
        significantly compromised and look terrible in the console for users. If it is
        not possible to disable such output with e.g. a flag for the command, then
        disabling streaming may be necessary. As an example, the ``flatpak install``
        command uses many animations.

        If a command requires user input, do not use output streaming. The output
        streaming implementation doesn't provide any facilities to send input to the
        process and doesn't provide any special handling of stdin. Additionally, when
        the command process prompts the user for input, that doesn't always trigger
        ``readline()`` to return; so, the console may actually end up waiting for user
        input before displaying a prompt to the user. As an example, accepting Android
        SDK licenses requires user input.
