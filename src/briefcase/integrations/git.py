        Unfortunately, `import git` triggers a call on the operating system
        to run the git executable. On some platforms (notably macOS), the git
        binary has been instrumented such that if git *isn't* installed,
        running git triggers a prompt to install Xcode. However, that messes
        with the UX workflow.

        So - we defer importing git until we actually know we need it. This
        enables Briefcase to start to do other Xcode checks as part of the macOS
        workflows, and ensures that "briefcase --help" works on other platforms
        without raising an error.
