        """Determine whether Docker is mapping users between the container and the host.

        Docker can be installed in different ways on Linux that significantly impact how
        containers interact with the host system. Of particular note is ownership of
        files and directories in bind mounts (i.e. mounts using --volume).

        Traditionally, Docker would pass through the UID/GID of the user used inside a
        container as the owner of files created within the bind mount. And since the
        default user inside containers is root, the files would be owned by root on the
        host file system; this prevents later interaction with those files by the host.
        To work around this, the Dockerfile can use a step-down user with a UID and GID
        that matches the host user running Docker.

        Other installation methods of Docker, though, are not compatible with using such
        a step-down user. This includes Docker Desktop and rootless Docker (although,
        even a traditional installation of Docker Engine can be configured similarly).
        In these modes, Docker maps the host user to the root user inside the container;
        this mapping is transparent and would require changes to the host environment to
        disable, if it can be disabled at all. This allows files created in bind mounts
        inside the container to be owned on the host file system by the user running
        Docker. Additionally, though, because the host user is mapped to root inside the
        container, any files that were created by the host user in the bind mount
        outside the container are owned by root inside the container; therefore, a step-
        down user could not interact with such bind mount files inside the container.

        To accommodate these different modes, this checks which user owns a file that is
        created inside a bind mount in the container. If the owning user of that file on
        the host file system is root, then a step-down user is necessary inside
        containers. If the owning user is the host user, root should be used.

        On macOS, Docker Desktop is the only option to use Docker and user mapping
        happens differently such that any user in the container is mapped to the host
        user. Instead of leveraging user namespaces as on Linux, this user mapping
        manifests as a consequence of bind mounts being implemented as NFS shares
        between macOS and the Linux VM that Docker Desktop runs containers in. So,
        using a step-down user on macOS is effectively inconsequential.

        On Windows WSL 2, Docker Desktop operates similarly to how it does on Linux.
        However, user namespace mapping is not possible because the Docker Desktop VM
        and the WSL distro are already running in different user namespaces...and
        therefore, Docker cannot even see the users in the distro to map them in to the
        container. So, a step-down user is always used.
