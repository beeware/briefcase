Briefcase Linux AppImage Template
=================================

A `Cookiecutter <https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter/>`__ template for
building Python apps that will run under Linux, packaged as an AppImage.

Using this template
-------------------

The easiest way to use this project is to not use it at all - at least, not
directly. `Briefcase <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/>`__ is a tool that
uses this template, rolling it out using data extracted from a
``pyproject.toml`` configuration file.

However, if you *do* want use this template directly...

1. Install `cookiecutter`_. This is a tool used to bootstrap complex project
   templates::

    $ pip install cookiecutter

2. Run ``cookiecutter`` on the template::

    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/beeware/briefcase-linux-appimage-template

   This will ask you for a number of details of your application, including the
   `name` of your application (which should be a valid PyPI identifier), and
   the `Formal Name` of your application (the full name you use to describe
   your app). The remainder of these instructions will assume a `name` of
   ``my-project``, and a formal name of ``My Project``.

3. `Obtain a Python Linux support package for x86_64`_, and extract it into
   the ``My Project/My Project.AppDir/usr`` directory generated by the
   template. This will give you a self-contained Python install. If installed
   correctly, there should be a ``My Project/My
   Project.AppDir/usr/bin/python3`` binary, as well as some other
   Python-related files.

   Alternatively, you can download the `Python-Linux-support`_ project, and
   build your own versions of these frameworks. You will need to do this if
   you need to build for an architecture other than `x86_64`.

4. Add your code to the template, into the ``My Project/My Project.AppDir/usr/app``
   directory. At the very minimum, you need to have an
   ``app/<app name>/__main__.py`` file that defines an entry point that will
   start your application.

   If your code has any dependencies, they should be installed into the
   ``My Project/My Project.AppDir/usr/app_packages`` directory.

If you've done this correctly, a project with a formal name of ``My Project``,
with an app name of ``my-project`` should have a directory structure that
looks something like::

    My Project/
        My Project.AppDir/
            usr/
                app/
                    my_project/
                        __init__.py
                        __main__.py
                        app.py
                app_packages/
                    ...
                bin/
                    python3
                    ...
                lib/
                    ...
                share/
                    ...
            com.example.my-project.desktop
        briefcase.toml

This directory can then be compiled into an AppImage using `linuxdeploy`_.
Download the `linuxdeploy AppImage`_, and make the binary executable::

    $ chmod +x linuxdeploy-x86_64.AppImage

Then compile your AppDir directory (substituting your release version number)::

    $ VERSION=1.2.3 ./linuxdeploy-x86_64.AppImage --appdir=My\ Project/My\ Project.AppDir -o appimage -d My\ Project/My\ Project.AppDir/com.example.my-project.desktop

This will produce ``My Project-1.2.3-x86_64.AppImage``. This image can given
to any other Linux user, and should run without installing any other
dependencies.

Next steps
----------

Of course, running Python code isn't very interesting by itself.

To do something interesting, you'll need to work with the native system
libraries to draw widgets and respond to user input. The `GTK+`_ GUI library
provides Python bindings that you can use to build a user interface.
Alternatively, you could use a cross-platform widget toolkit that supports
Windows (such as `Toga`_) to provide a GUI for your application.

If you have any external library dependencies (like Toga, or anything other
third-party library), you should install the library code into the
``app_packages`` directory. This directory is the same as a  ``site_packages``
directory on a desktop Python install.
