# Square splash screen images
#
# At app launch, we try to fill the screen's width with a square image, along
# with a background color of `splash_background_color`. There will be some
# padding above/below the image when the phone is in portrait mode (or to the
# left/right of the image when the phone is in landscape mode). When the app
# starts, we remove the splash image.
#
# We use the "normal" series of images on devices whose smallest dimension
# ("width") is less than 480 density-independent pixels, typically 320.
# Denisty-independent pixels are a way to measure physical size of the screen,
# e.g., a 5" phone. We use the "large" series of images for devices with at
# least 480 density-independent pixels of width, but smaller than xlarge. We
# use the "xlarge" series of images for devices at least 720
# density-independent pixels of width.
#
# Normal corresponds to a typical phone. Large corresponds to a large phone, or
# phone-tablet hybrid (phablet). Xlarge corresponds to a large tablet.
#
# In addition to the normal/large/xlarge physical size distinction, we need to
# choose images appropriate for the device's current DPI. Android defines a
# variety of screen DPI buckets; we use mdpi (1x), hdpi (1.5x), xhdpi (2x), and
# xxxhdpi (4x). The device will choose the best image to use based on its
# actual DPI.
#
# The simplest way to create these images is to create the largest one at
# 2880x2880, then scale down. Create images whose width and height are the
# number in the splash image name (e.g., 320x320 for splash.normal.320).
