<!-- splash_image_box includes the splash image in a box whose size
     is appropriate to the screen size. This file is used by default.
     Other files in the res/ directory override the width and height.
     The first override occurs when min(height, width) >= 480dp. The
     most common size < 480dp is 320dp, so this file is written with
     that screen size in mind.
