Tutorial 0 - Hello, world!
==========================

In this tutorial, you'll take a really simple "Hello, world!" program written
in Python, convert it into a working project.

Setup
-----

This tutorial assumes you've read and followed the instructions in
:doc:`/tutorial/getting-started`. If you've done this, you should have:

* A ``tutorial`` directory,
* An activated Python 3.5+ virtual environment,
* Briefcase installed in that virtual environment,
* Any platform-specific dependencies installed.

Start a new project
-------------------

Let's get started by using
`the handy template <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase-template>`_
``briefcase-template``:

.. code-block:: bash

    (venv) $ pip install cookiecutter
    (venv) $ cookiecutter https://github.com/beeware/briefcase-template

This will ask a bunch of questions to you. We'll use a `formal_name` of 
"Hello World", an `app_name` of "helloworld", using the Toga GUI toolkit.
You can copy the default values [...] suggested for the other questions 
(or update them to reflect your own name if you want).

You'll now have a few files in this folder, including a ``helloworld``
directory.

Check out what the provided ``helloworld/app.py`` file contains:

.. code-block:: bash

    # If you are on macOS or Linux
    (venv) $ cd helloworld
    (venv) $ cat helloworld/app.py

.. code-block:: python

    # If you are on Windows command line
    (venv) > cd helloworld
    (venv) > type helloworld/app.py

.. code-block:: python


    import toga
    from toga.style import Pack
    from toga.style.pack import COLUMN, ROW


    class HelloWorld(toga.App):
        def startup(self):
            # Create a main window with a name matching the app
            self.main_window = toga.MainWindow(title=self.name)

            # Create a main content box
            main_box = toga.Box()

            # Add the content on the main window
            self.main_window.content = main_box

            # Show the main window
            self.main_window.show()


    def main():
        return HelloWorld('Hello World', 'com.example.helloworld')

Put it in a briefcase
---------------------

Your project is now ready to use ``briefcase``.

Windows
~~~~~~~

You must use Windows command line (``cmd``) to run this step. In case
you have installed MingW32, Linux compatibility layer for Windows or similar,
make sure it doesn't interfere with ``cmd`` environment.

To create and run the application, run:

.. code-block:: python

    (venv) > python setup.py windows -s

This will produce a ``windows`` subdirectory that will contain a
``HelloWorld-0.0.1.msi`` installer. If you get an error stating that
Wix Tools cannot be found, and you have already installed them, try restarting
your computer.

macOS
~~~~~

To create and run the application, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    (venv) $ python setup.py macos -s

This will produce a ``macOS`` subdirectory that contains a ``Hello World.app``
application bundle. This bundle can be dragged into your Applications folder,
or zipped and distributed to anyone else.

Linux
~~~~~

To create and run the application, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    (venv) $ python setup.py linux -s

This will produce a ``linux`` subdirectory that contains a ``Hello World``
script that will start the application.

iOS
~~~

To create and run the application, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    (venv) $ python setup.py ios -s

This will start the iOS simulator (you may be asked to select an API and a
simulator device on which to run the app) and run your app.

It will also produce an ``ios`` subdirectory that contains an XCode project
called ``Hello World.xcodeproj``. You can open this project in XCode to run
your application.

Android
~~~~~~~

To create and run the application, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    (venv) $ python setup.py android -s

This will produce an ``android`` subdirectory that contains a Gradle project.
It will also launch the app on the first Android device or simulator that
can be found running on (or attached to) your computer.

What should happen
------------------

When the application runs, you should see a window with a title of "Hello
World" appear. The window won't contain any content - but it will be a native
application, with a native icon in your task bar (or wherever icons appear on
your platform).

You've just packaged your first app with Briefcase! Now, let's :doc:`make the
app actually do something interesting </tutorial/tutorial-1>`.
