# Release History

## 0.3.25 (2025-08-26) {#section}

### Features

- Android apps can now pass `--forward-port` and `--reverse-port` to
  connect ports in the emulated device to the host environment
  ([\#2369](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2369))
- Android applications now target Android SDK 35 by default.
  ([\#2393](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2393))
- Support for Python 3.14 has been added.
  ([\#2431](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2431))
- Windows apps and Visual Studio projects can now reference pre-release
  Python versions as a support revision.
  ([\#2432](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2432))
- If an iOS or macOS app doesn't specify a minimum OS version, the
  minimum OS version is now derived from the support package, rather
  than being hard coded.
  ([\#2443](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2443))

### Bugfixes

- Apps that contain file paths longer than 260 characters can now be
  included in MSI installers.
  ([\#948](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/948))
- Windows builds now have improved hints when a virus checker interrupts
  a build. ([\#1530](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1530))
- Wheels that contain Linux `.so` files are now usable on macOS.
  ([\#2429](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2429))
- iOS and macOS apps now read the minimum supported OS version from the
  Python framework's metadata, rather than requiring a `VERSIONS` file
  as part of the support package.
  ([\#2443](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2443))

### Backward Incompatible Changes

- Support for Python 3.9 has been dropped.
  ([\#2431](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2431))

### Documentation

- Details on usage of iOS and Android third-party wheels have been
  updated to reflect recent changes in the Python packaging ecosystem.

## 0.3.24 (2025-07-10) {#section-1}

### Features

- When an iOS or macOS binary wheel cannot be found, the error message
  now provides more useful hints regarding the possible cause.
  ([\#2230](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2230))
- Document type and file associations have been improved on macOS.
  ([\#2284](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2284))
- Briefcase can now be used to sign, package and notarize apps that
  Briefcase didn't create. You can now use another tool to create a
  macOS, Windows or Linux application, and then use Briefcase to
  complete the process of turning that app into a signed and notarized
  release artefact.
  ([\#2326](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2326))

### Bugfixes

- A redundant signing phase has been removed when packaging an apps for
  macOS. ([\#1099](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1099))
- An error is now raised on macOS if Briefcase is used on an iCloud
  mounted drive. iCloud synchronization adds metadata to some folders,
  which is incompatible with the signing process.
  ([\#1808](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1808))
- An app's formal name can now include a `.` character.
  ([\#2151](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2151))
- Distribution-specific cumulative settings (such as `requires`) now
  correctly accumulate, rather than overwriting more general values.
  ([\#2188](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2188))
- Briefcase will now default to using the system certificate store when
  performing HTTPS downloads.
  ([\#2296](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2296))
- Briefcase now provides richer error information when it is unable to
  complete a download. In particular, issues associated with SSL
  verification are now reported as such, rather than as a generic "are
  you offline?" message.
  ([\#2296](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2296))
- The presence of a `PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV` environment marker no
  longer influences the operation of dependency installation on iOS. The
  iOS installation environments is inherently isolated, so this flag is
  redundant; but in some circumstances, it would prevent the
  installation of dependencies into a project.
  ([\#2325](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2325))

### Backward Incompatible Changes

- Briefcase now uses WiX version 5.0.2 to generate MSI installers on
  Windows. Any Windows apps created with previous versions of Briefcase
  will need to be re-generated by running `briefcase create`.
  ([\#1185](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1185))

### Documentation

- Documentation about deploying to physical iOS devices has been added.
  ([\#1190](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1190))
- References to Briefcase's settings are now hyperlinked for ease of
  cross-referencing.
  ([\#2341](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2341))
- A guide for publishing apps to the macOS App Store has been added.
  ([\#2360](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2360))
- Briefcase's documentation now uses a header and style consistent with
  the BeeWare website.
  ([\#2375](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2375))

## 0.3.23 (2025-05-08) {#section-2}

### Features

- Cookiecutter filters for escaping XML content and attributes have been
  added. ([\#2103](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2103))
- Briefcase now supports the use of `HISTORY`, `NEWS` and `RELEASES` as
  filenames for the change log of a project (in addition to
  `CHANGELOG`). It also supports the use of `.md`, `.rst` and `.txt`
  extensions on those files.
  ([\#2116](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2116))
- It is now possible to ask Boolean question using the Console
  Interface.
  ([\#2128](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2128))
- The `create`, `build`, `package` and `update` commands can now be run
  on a single app within a multi-app project by using the `-a` / `--app`
  option. ([\#2148](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2148))
- The Toga app bootstrap now generates apps that use Toga 0.5.
  ([\#2193](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2193))
- An app can now enforce a minimum supported OS version by defining a
  `min_os_version` configuration item on a per-platform basis. This
  minimum value will be used on macOS, iOS and Android deployments.
  ([\#2233](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2233))
- The Flatpak runtimes for new projects were updated.
  `org.gnome.Platform` will now default to 47; and `org.kde.Platform`
  will now default to 6.9.
  ([\#2258](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2258))
- Android packages are now built using version 19.0 of Android's
  Command-line Tools; this version will be automatically installed at
  first use.
  ([\#2260](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2260))
- When creating a new project with `briefcase new`, or converting an
  existing project with `briefcase convert`, Briefcase will now try to
  infer the author's name and email address from the git configuration.
  ([\#2269](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2269))

### Bugfixes

- `.pth` files created by packages installed as dependencies are now
  correctly processed during application startup on macOS, Windows,
  Linux and iOS.
  ([\#381](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/381))
- Error handling during JDK upgrades has been improved.
  ([\#1520](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1520))
- The iOS log filter was improved to hide an message about `getpwuid_r`
  that can be ignored.
  ([\#2163](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2163))
- New apps using Toga on Linux will impose an upper version pin on
  PyGObject, limiting that package to `< 3.52.1`. This is required to
  ensure that older Debian-based distributions are supported by default.
  This pin can be removed if these support for these distributions is
  not required, as long as some additional changes are made to the
  `system_requires` and `system_runtime_requires` definitions. The
  required changes are included (commented out) as part of the new
  project template.
  ([\#2190](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2190))
- License names now follow the [SPDX License
  List](https://spdx.org/licenses/).
  ([\#2270](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2270))

### Backward Incompatible Changes

- Briefcase can no longer install pure Python macOS packages from a
  source archive (i.e., a `.tar.gz` file published on PyPI). If a
  package is pure Python, it *must* be provided as a `py3-none-any`
  wheel. Briefcase's [macOS platform
  documentation](https://briefcase.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/platforms/macOS/index.html)
  contains details on how to provide a `py3-none-any` wheel when PyPI
  does not provide one.
  ([\#2163](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2163))
- The `app_packages` folder now occurs *after* the `app` folder in the
  package resolution path on Windows, Linux, macOS and iOS. This will
  result in subtle changes in behavior if you have packages defined in
  your `sources` that have the same name as packages installed from your
  `requires`.
  ([\#2204](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2204))
- The iOS app template no longer uses the `iphoneos_deployment_target`
  setting to configure the minimum OS version. This variable was
  undocumented; you should modify any usage of this variable to the
  newly added (and documented) `min_os_version` setting.
  ([\#2233](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2233))
- If you have a PySide6 app deployed to macOS, you must add
  `min_os_version = "12.0"` to your macOS project configuration. As of
  PySide 6.8.0, PySide6 macOS wheels are tagged with a minimum supported
  macOS version of 12.0. Previously, Briefcase would install the macOS
  12 wheel, but the Briefcase app would declare itself as supporting
  macOS 11. This would cause errors if the app was run on macOS 11.
  Briefcase will no longer install macOS wheels that are incompatible
  with the minimum OS version declared by the app (11.0 by default). The
  additional `min_os_version` configuration option is now required to
  allow Briefcase to resolve the installation of PySide6 wheels.
  ([\#2240](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2240))
- Java JDK 17.0.15+6 is now used to package Android apps. Use
  `briefcase upgrade java` to update your Briefcase-installed JDK
  instance to this version.
  ([\#2259](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2259))
- The `new` command now uses [SPDX
  identifiers](https://spdx.org/licenses/) when referring to licenses.
  If you have been using the `-Q license=XXX` option to automate
  application creation, you will need to modify the value provided to
  match the SPDX specifier for that license (e.g., `MIT` instead of
  `MIT license`, and `BSD-3-Clause` instead of `BSD`).
  ([\#2270](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2270))

### Documentation

- A how to guide for command-line apps was added.
  ([\#1947](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1947))
- Platform notes were added on removing static binary content from iOS
  and macOS apps.
  ([\#2161](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2161))
- The macOS and Windows platform documentation has been simplified to
  remove duplication of content between output formats.

## 0.3.22 (2025-02-07) {#section-3}

### Bugfixes

- Some error messages that are an expected part of the macOS
  notarization process are now hidden from default verbosity.
  ([\#2149](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2149))
- Briefcase no longer uses the `--no-python-version-warning` option when
  invoking pip. This option has been deprecated, is currently a no-op,
  and will be removed soon.
  ([\#2149](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2149))

### Backward Incompatible Changes

- Java JDK 17.0.14+7 is now used to package Android apps. Use
  `briefcase upgrade java` to update your Briefcase-installed JDK
  instance to this version.
  ([\#2133](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2133))

## 0.3.21 (2025-01-24) {#section-4}

### Features

- Briefcase will now surface git's error messages if an error occurs
  when cloning a template repository.
  ([\#1118](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1118))
- Briefcase now supports per-app configuration of `pip install` command
  line arguments using `requirement_installer_args`.
  ([\#1270](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1270))
- If macOS app notarization is interrupted, the notarization attempt can
  now be resumed.
  ([\#1472](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1472))
- When a macOS notarization attempt fails, Briefcase now displays the
  cause of the notarization failure.
  ([\#1472](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1472))
- When an existing project uses the `convert` wizard to add a Briefcase
  configuration, the updated `pyproject.toml` now includes a stub
  configuration for all platforms.
  ([\#1899](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1899))
- The `briefcase convert` command can now be used to configure a
  console-based applications.
  ([\#1900](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1900))
- If Briefcase receives an error invoking a system tool, it will now
  surface the raw error message to the user in addition to logging the
  error. ([\#1907](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1907))
- The project wizard now generates a more complete configuration file
  when no GUI framework is selected.
  ([\#2006](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2006))
- The web template now targets PyScript version 2024.11.1. In addition,
  the web template can provide a base `pyscript.toml` that Briefcase
  will update as required during the build process.
  ([\#2080](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2080))
- Briefcase now uses native pip handling for iOS installs.
  ([\#2101](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2101))
- When a verbosity level of 3 (i.e., `-vvv`) is selected, any tasks that
  would normally be performed in parallel will now be performed
  serially. ([\#2110](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2110))
- Linux on arm64 is now a fully supported platform.
  ([\#2113](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2113))
- Project bootstraps now have access to the Briefcase console and the
  overrides specified with `-Q` options at the command line.
  ([\#2114](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2114))
- Project bootstraps can now define a `post_generate()` extension point.
  This will be invoked after the new project template has been
  generated, providing a way for bootstraps to add additional files to
  the generated project.
  ([\#2119](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2119))

### Bugfixes

- Briefcase now uses `ditto` to archive apps for submission to the
  notarization service, rather than standard `zip` tooling. This ensures
  that UTF-8 encoding and file system resources are preserved.
  ([\#1218](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1218))
- The Gradle file generated for Android projects now correctly escapes
  single quotes.
  ([\#1876](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1876))
- Pre-release Python interpreter versions are no longer rejected as
  matching candidates in PEP 621 `requires-python` checks.
  ([\#2034](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2034))
- Briefcase no longer fails to create projects or builds because it
  cannot update the Git configuration for the relevant template.
  ([\#2077](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2077))
- Support packages for Linux Flatpak and AppImage builds are now
  downloaded from the `astral-sh` repository, rather than the `indygreg`
  repository. This reflect the recent transfer of ownership of the
  project. ([\#2087](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2087))
- A Debian-based system that does *not* have `build-essential`
  installed, but *does* have the constituent packages of
  `build-essential` installed, can now build Briefcase system packages.
  ([\#2096](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2096))
- The arguments passed to `xcodebuild` when compiling an iOS app have
  been modified to avoid a warning about an ignored argument.
  ([\#2102](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2102))
- The hints displayed to the user when an identity has been selected now
  more accurately reflect the context in which they have been invoked.
  ([\#2110](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2110))

### Backward Incompatible Changes

- Flatpak apps no longer request D-Bus session access by default. Most
  apps have no need to access the D-Bus session, unless they're a
  development tool that is inspecting D-Bus messages at runtime. If you
  experience errors related to this change, it is likely caused by an
  inconsistency between the `bundle` definition in your app
  configuration, and the way the app describes its bundle ID at runtime.
  If you *do* require D-Bus access, adding
  `finish_arg."socket=session-bus" = true` to the Flatpak configuration
  for your app will restore D-Bus session access.
  ([\#2074](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2074))
- Briefcase can no longer install pure Python iOS packages from a source
  archive (i.e., a `.tar.gz` file published on PyPI). If a package is
  pure Python, it *must* be provided as a `py3-none-any` wheel.
  Briefcase's [iOS platform
  documentation](https://briefcase.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/platforms/iOS/xcode.html#requirements-cannot-be-provided-as-source-tarballs)
  contains details on how to provide a `py3-none-any` wheel when PyPI
  does not provide one.
  ([\#2101](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2101))
- The API for project bootstraps has been slightly modified. The
  constructor for a bootstrap must now accept a console argument; the
  `extra_context()` method must now accept a `project_overrides`
  argument. ([\#2114](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2114))

## 0.3.20 (2024-10-15) {#section-5}

### Features

- Support for Python 3.13 has been added.
- When the available version of Git is older than v2.17.0, an error
  message now prompts the user to upgrade their install of Git to
  proceed. ([\#1915](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1915))
- Apps packaged for Flatpak and AppImage now use a stripped (and
  smaller) Python support package.
  ([\#1929](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1929))
- macOS app templates can now specify what part of the support package
  should be copied into the final application bundle.
  ([\#1933](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1933))
- The Flatpak runtimes for new projects were updated.
  `org.freedesktop.Platform` will now default to 24.08;
  `org.gnome.Platform` will now default to 46; and `org.kde.Platform`
  will now default to 6.7.
  ([\#1987](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1987))
- Briefcase will now validate that the running Python interpreter meets
  requirements specified by the PEP 621 `requires-python` setting. If
  `requires-python` is not set, there is no change in behavior.
  Briefcase will also validate that `requires-python` is a valid version
  specifier as laid out by PEP 621's requirements.
  ([\#2016](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2016))

### Bugfixes

- Document type declarations are now fully validated.
  ([\#1846](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1846))
- The order in which nested frameworks and apps are signed on macOS has
  been corrected.
  ([\#1891](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1891))
- The spacing after the New Project wizard prompts are now consistent.
  ([\#1896](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1896))

  dependencies in its configuration has been corrected.
  ([\#1905](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1905))
- The log filter for iOS has been modified to capture logs generated
  when using PEP 730-style binary modules.
  ([\#1933](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1933))
- Briefcase is now able to remove symbolic links to directories as part
  of the template cleanup.
  ([\#1933](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1933))
- If a macOS support package contains symbolic links, those symbolic
  links will be preserved when the support package is copied into the
  app bundle.
  ([\#1933](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1933))
- Briefcase will no longer attempt to sign symbolic links in macOS apps.
  ([\#1933](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1933))
- Packages that include `.dist-info` content in vendored dependencies
  are now ignored as part of the binary widening process on macOS. If a
  binary package has vendored sub-packages, it is assumed that the
  top-level package includes the vendored packages' files in its wheel
  manifest. ([\#1970](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1970))
- The types used by `AppContext` in GUI toolkit bootstraps for creating
  new projects have been corrected.
  ([\#1988](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1988))

  `-d` and other flags that accept values. This incompatibility has been
  corrected.
  ([\#2026](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/2026))

### Backward Incompatible Changes

- Java JDK 17.0.12+7 is now used to package Android apps. Use
  `briefcase upgrade java` to update your Briefcase-installed JDK
  instance to this version.
  ([\#1920](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1920))
- Support for Python 3.8 has been dropped.
  ([\#1934](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1934))
- macOS and iOS templates have both had an epoch increase. macOS and iOS
  projects created with previous versions of Briefcase will need to be
  re-generated.
  ([\#1934](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1934))
- Any project using binary modules on iOS will need to be recompiled to
  use the binary linking format and wheel tag specified by [PEP
  730](https://peps.python.org/pep-0730/)
  ([\#1934](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1934))

### Documentation

- A how-to guide for building apps in GitHub Actions CI was added.
  ([\#400](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/400))
- Fixed error in example in briefcase run documentation.
  ([\#1928](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1928))

## 0.3.19 (2024-06-12) {#section-6}

### Features

- Briefcase can now package command line apps.
  ([\#556](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/556))
- Templates that use pre-compiled stub binaries can now manage that
  artefact as an independent resource, rather than needing to include
  the binary in the template repository. This significantly reduces the
  size of the macOS and Windows app templates.
  ([\#933](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/933))
- Template repositories are now fetched as blobless partial Git clones,
  reducing the size of initial downloads.
  ([\#933](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/933))
- macOS now supports the generation of `.pkg` installers as a packaging
  format. ([\#1184](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1184))
- Android SDK Command Line Tools 12.0 is now used to build Android apps.
  ([\#1778](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1778))
- The new project wizard now includes links to known third-party GUI
  bootstraps.
  ([\#1807](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1807))
- The name of the license file can now be specified using a PEP
  621-compliant format for the `license` setting.
  ([\#1812](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1812))
- The default Gradle dependencies for a Toga project no longer includes
  `SwipeRefreshLayout`.
  ([\#1845](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1845))

### Bugfixes

- Validation rules for bundle identifiers have been loosened. App IDs
  that contain country codes or language reserved words are no longer
  flagged as invalid.
  ([\#1212](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1212))
- macOS code signing no longer uses the deprecated "deep signing"
  option. ([\#1221](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1221))
- If `run` is executed directly after a `create` when using an `app`
  template on macOS or Windows, the implied `build` step is now
  correctly identified.
  ([\#1729](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1729))
- Escaping of quotation marks in TOML templates was corrected.
  ([\#1746](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1746))
- The Docker version on OpenSUSE Tumbleweed is now accepted and no
  longer triggers a warning message.
  ([\#1773](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1773))
- The formal name of an app is now validated.
  ([\#1810](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1810))
- macOS apps now generate `info.plist` entries for camera, photo library
  and microphone permissions.
  ([\#1820](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1820))

### Backward Incompatible Changes

- Briefcase now uses a private cache of Cookiecutter templates, rather
  than the shared `~/.cookiecutters` directory. You can reclaim disk
  space by deleting `~/.cookiecutters/briefcase-*` and
  `~/.cookiecutter_replay/briefcase-*` (or the entire `~/.cookiecutters`
  and `~/.cookiecutter_replay` folders if you are not using Cookiecutter
  for any other purposes).
  ([\#933](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/933))
- The macOS `app` packaging format has been renamed `zip` for
  consistency with Windows, and to reflect the format of the output
  artefact. ([\#1781](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1781))
- The format for the `license` field has been converted to PEP 621
  format. Existing projects that specify `license` as a string should
  update their configurations to point at the generated license file
  using `license.file = "LICENSE"`.
  ([\#1812](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1812))
- The PursuedPyBear bootstrap has been migrated to be part of the
  PursuedPyBear project.
  ([\#1834](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1834))

### Documentation

- Documentation describing manual signing requirement for Android
  packages has been added.
  ([\#1703](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1703))
- Documentation of Briefcase's support for document types has been
  improved. ([\#1771](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1771))
- Documentation on Briefcase's plug-in interfaces was added.
  ([\#1807](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1807))
- Documentation on the use of passwords in Android publication now
  encourages users to set non-default passwords.

### Bugfixes

- Build warnings caused by bugs in Xcode that can be safely ignored are
  now filtered out of visible output.
  ([\#377](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/377))
- The run command now ensures Android logging is shown when the datetime
  on the device is different from the host machine.
  ([\#1146](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1146))
- Briefcase will detect if you attempt to launch an Android app on a
  device whose OS doesn't meet minimum version requirements.
  ([\#1157](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1157))
- macOS apps are now guaranteed to be universal binaries, even when
  dependencies only provide single-architecture binary wheels.
  ([\#1217](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1217))
- The ability to build AppImages in Docker on macOS was restored.
  ([\#1352](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1352))
- Error reporting has been improved when the target Docker image name is
  invalid. ([\#1368](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1368))
- Creating Debian packages no longer fails due to a permission error for
  certain `umask` values (such as `0077`).
  ([\#1369](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1369))
- Inside of Docker containers, the Briefcase data directory is now
  mounted at `/briefcase` instead of `/home/brutus/.cache/briefcase`.
  ([\#1374](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1374))
- The console output from invoking Python via a subprocess call is now
  properly decoded as UTF-8.
  ([\#1407](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1407))
- The command line arguments used to configure the Python environment
  for `briefcase dev` no longer leak into the runtime environment on
  macOS. ([\#1413](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1413))

### Backward Incompatible Changes

- AppImage packaging requires a recent release of LinuxDeploy to
  continue creating AppImages. Run `briefcase upgrade linuxdeploy` to
  install the latest version.
  ([\#1361](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1361))
- The size of iOS splash images have changed. iOS apps should now
  provide 800px, 1600px and 2400px images (previously, this as 1024px,
  2048px and 3072px). This is because iOS 14 added a hard limit on the
  size of image resources.
  ([\#1371](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1371))
- Support for AppImage has been reduced to "best effort". We will
  maintain unit test coverage for the AppImage backend, but we no longer
  build AppImages as part of our release process. We will accept bug
  reports related to AppImage support, and we will merge PRs that
  address AppImage support, but the core team no longer considers
  addressing AppImage bugs a priority, and discourages the use of
  AppImage for new projects.
  ([\#1449](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1449))

### Documentation

- Documentation on the process of retrieving certificate identities on
  macOS and Windows was improved.

## 0.3.15 (2023-07-10) {#section-10}

### Features

- Windows apps can now be packaged as simple ZIP files.
  ([\#457](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/457))
- An Android SDK specified in `ANDROID_HOME` is respected now and will
  take precedence over the setting of `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`.
  ([\#463](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/463))
- Android support was upgraded to use Java 17 for builds.
  ([\#1065](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1065))

  ([\#1083](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1083))
- The company/author name in the installation path for Windows MSI
  installers is now optional.
  ([\#1199](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1199))
- macOS code signing is now multi-threaded (and therefore much faster!)
  ([\#1201](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1201))
- Briefcase will now honor PEP-621 project fields where they map to
  Briefcase configuration items.
  ([\#1203](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1203))

### Bugfixes

- XML compatibility warnings generated by the Android build have been
  cleaned up. ([\#827](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/827))
- Non ASCII characters provided in the `briefcase new` wizard are quoted
  before being put into `pyproject.toml`.
  ([\#1011](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1011))
- Requests to the web server are now recorded in the log file.
  ([\#1090](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1090))
- An "Invalid Keystore format" error is no longer raised when signing an
  app if the local Android keystore was generated with a recent version
  of Java. ([\#1112](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1112))
- Content before a closing square bracket (`]`) or `.so)` is no longer
  stripped by the macOS and iOS log filter.
  ([\#1179](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1179))
- The option to run Linux system packages through Docker was removed.
  ([\#1207](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1207))
- Error handling for incomplete or corrupted GitHub clones of templates
  has been improved.
  ([\#1210](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1210))
- Application/Bundle IDs are normalized to replace underscores with
  dashes when possible
  ([\#1234](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1234))
- Filenames and directories in RPM package definitions are quoted in
  order to include filenames that include white space.
  ([\#1236](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1236))
- Briefcase will no longer display progress bars if the `FORCE_COLOR`
  environment variable is set.
  ([\#1267](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1267))
- When creating a new Briefcase project, the header line in
  `pyproject.toml` now contains the version of Briefcase instead of
  "Unknown". ([\#1276](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1276))
- Android logs no longer include timestamp and PID, making them easier
  to read on narrow screens.
  ([\#1286](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1286))

  no longer be used as an application name.
  ([\#853](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/853))
- The `--no-sign` option for packaging was removed. Briefcase will now
  prompt for a signing identity during packaging, falling back to
  adhoc/no signing as a default where possible.
  ([\#865](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/865))
- The version of OpenJDK for Java was updated from 8 to 17. Any Android
  apps generated on previous versions of Briefcase must be re-generated
  by running `briefcase create android gradle`. If customizations were
  made to files within the generated app, they will need to be manually
  re-applied after re-running the create command.
  ([\#1065](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1065))
- Flatpak apps no longer default to using the Freedesktop runtime and
  SDK version 21.08 when a runtime is not specified. Instead, the
  runtime now must be explicitly defined in the [application
  configuration](https://briefcase.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/platforms/linux/flatpak.html#application-configuration).
  ([\#1272](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1272))

  canceling the command altogether.
  ([\#1141](https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1141))
- When `JAVA_HOME` contains a path to a file instead of a directory,
  Briefcase will now warn the user and install an isolated copy of Java

### Features

- iOS and Android now supports the installation of binary packages.
  (#471)
- Apps can now selectively remove files from the final app bundle using
  the `cleanup_paths` attribute. (#550)
- The Docker image for AppImage builds is created or updated for all
  commands instead of just `create`. (#796)
- The performance of Briefcase's tool verification process has been
  improved. (#801)
- Briefcase templates are now versioned by the Briefcase version, rather
  than the Python version. (#824)
- Android commands now start faster, as they only gather a list of SDK
  packages when needed to write a log file. (#832)
- Log messages can be captured on iOS if they originate from a
  dynamically loaded module. (#842)
- Added an "open" command that can be used to open projects in IDEs.
  (#846)

### Bugfixes

- The Wait Bar is disabled for batch scripts on Windows to prevent
  hiding user prompts when CTRL+C is pressed. (#811)
- Android emulators that don't provide a model identifier can now be
  used to launch apps. (#820)
- All `linuxdeploy` plugins are made executable and ELF headers for
  AppImage plugins are patched for use in `Docker`. (#829)
- The RCEdit plugin can now be upgraded. (#837)
- When verifying the existence of the Android emulator, Briefcase now
  looks for the actual binary, not the folder that contains the binary.
  This was causing false positives on some Android SDK setups. (#841)
- When CTRL+C is entered while an external program is running,
  `briefcase` will properly abort and exit. (#851)
- An issue with running <span class="title-ref">briefcase dev</span> on
  projects that put their application module in the project root has
  been resolved. (#863)

### Improved Documentation

## 0.3.9 (2022-08-17) {#section-16}

### Features

- Linux apps can now be packaged in Flatpak format. (#359)
- SDKs, tools, and other downloads needed to support app builds are now
  stored in an OS-native user cache directory instead of `~/.briefcase`.
  (#374)
- Windows MSI installers can now be configured to ask the user whether
  they want a per-user or per-machine install. (#382)
- The console output of Windows apps is now captured and displayed
  during `briefcase run`. (#620)
- Windows apps are now packaged with a stub application. This ensures
  that Windows apps present with the name and icon of the app, rather
  than the `pythonw.exe` name and icon. It also allows for improvements
  in logging and error handling. (#629)
- Temporary docker containers are now cleaned up after use. The wording
  of Docker progress messages has also been improved. (#774)
- Users can now define a `BRIEFCASE_HOME` environment variable. This
  allows you to specify the location of the Briefcase tool cache,
  allowing the user to avoid issues with spaces in paths or disk space
  limitations. (#789)
- Android emulator output is now printed to the console if it fails to
  start properly. (#799)
- `briefcase android run` now shows logs from only the current process,
  and includes all log tags except some particularly noisy and useless
  ones. It also no longer clears the `logcat` buffer. (#814)

### Bugfixes

- Apps now have better isolation against the current working directory.
  This ensures that code in the current working directory isn't
  inadvertently included when an app runs. (#662)
- Windows MSI installers now install in `Program Files`, rather than
  `Program Files (x86)`. (#688)
- Linuxdeploy plugins can now be used when building Linux AppImages;
  this resolves many issues with GTK app deployment. (#756)
- Collision protection has been added to custom support packages that
  have the same name, but are served by different URLs. (#797)
- Python 3.7 and 3.8 on Windows will no longer deadlock when CTRL+C is
  sent during a subprocess command. (#809)

  when the app exits. (#742)
- A verbose log is written to file when a critical error occurs or --log
  is specified. (#760)

### Bugfixes

- Updating an Android app now forces a re-install of the app. This
  corrects a problem (usually seen on physical devices) where app
  updates wouldn't be deployed if the app was already on the device.
  (#395)
- The iOS simulator is now able to correctly detect the iOS version when
  only a device name is provided. (#528)

  independently to the existence of the emulator. (#762)
- The error message presented when the Xcode Command Line Tools are
  installed, but Xcode is not, has been clarified. (#763)
- The METADATA file generated by Briefcase is now UTF-8 encoded, so it
  can handle non-Latin-1 characters. (#767)
- Output from subprocesses is correctly encoded, avoiding errors
  (especially on Windows) when tool output includes non-ASCII content.
  (#770)

### Improved Documentation

- Documented a workaround for ELF load command address/offset errors
  seen when using manylinux wheels. (#718)

### Misc

- \#743, \#744, \#755

  your target platform. (#486)
- Windows MSI installers can be configured to be per-machine,
  system-wide installers. (#498)
- Projects can specify a custom branch for the template used to generate
  the app. (#519)
- Added the <span class="title-ref">--no-run</span> flag to the *dev*
  command. This allows developers to install app dependencies without
  running the app. (#522)
- The new project wizard will now warn users when they select a platform
  that doesn't support mobile deployment. (#539)

### Bugfixes

- Modified the volume mounting process to allow for SELinux. (#500)

  clashes with the installation of application packages. (#441)
- Docker-using commands now check whether the Docker daemon is running
  and if the user has permission to access it. (#442)

## 0.3.2 (2020-07-04) {#section-23}

### Features

- Added pytest coverage to CI/CD process. (#417)
- Application metadata now contains a `Briefcase-Version` indicator.
  (#425)
- The device list returned by `briefcase run android` now uses the
  Android device model name and unique ID e.g. a Pixel 3a shows up as
  `Pixel 3a (adbDeviceId)`. (#433)
- Android apps are now packaged in Android App Bundle format. This
  allows the Play Store to dynamically build the smallest APK
  appropriate to a device installing an app. (#438)

- \#428

## 0.3.1 (2020-06-13) {#section-24}

### Features

- The Linux AppImage backend has been modified to use Docker. This
  ensures that the AppImage is always built in an environment that is
  compatible with the support package. It also enables Linux AppImages
  to be built on macOS and Windows. "Native" builds (i.e., builds that
  *don't* use Docker) can be invoked using the `--no-docker` argument.
  (#344)
- A `PYTHONPATH` property has been added to `AppConfig` that describes
  the `sys.path` changes needed to run the app. (#401)
- Ad-hoc code signing is now possible on macOS with
  `briefcase package --adhoc-sign`. (#409)
- Android apps can now use use `-` in their bundle name; we now convert
  `-` to `_` in the resulting Android package identifier and Java
  package name. (#415)
- Mobile applications now support setting the background color of the
  splash screen, and setting a build identifier. (#422)
- Android now has a `package` command that produces the release APK.
  After manually signing this APK, it can be published to the Google
  Play Store. (#423)

### Bugfixes

- Some stray punctuation in the Android device helper output has been
  removed. (#396)
- An explicit version check for Docker is now performed. (#402)
- The Linux build process ensures the Docker user matches the UID/GID of
  the host user. (#403)
- Briefcase now ensures that the Python installation ecosystem tools
  (`pip`, `setuptools`, and `wheel`), are all present and up to date.
  (#421)

### Improved Documentation

- Documented that Windows MSI builds produce per-user installable MSI
  installers, while still supporting per-machine installs via the CLI.
  (#382)
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` has been updated to link to Briefcase-specific
  documentation. (#404)
- Removed references to the `build-system` table in `pyproject.toml`.
