When generating a web project, Briefcase produces a static folder of
HTML, CSS and JavaScript resources that can be deployed as a web site.
The static website is packaged as a `.zip` file for distribution.

Although Briefcase provides a `run` command that can be used to serve
the website, this web server is provided as a development convenience.
**It should not be used in production**. If you wish to serve your app
in production, you can unzip the `.zip` file in the root of any web
server that can serve static web content.

/// admonition | Web support is experimental!

[PyScript](https://pyscript.net) (which forms the base of Briefcase's
web backend) is a new project; and Toga's web backend is very new. As a
result this web backend should be considered experimental.

Regardless of what Python version you run Briefcase with, the app will
use PyScript's current Python version (as of October 2022, this is
3.10).

There are also a [number of constraints](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/wasm-constraints.html)
on what you can do in a web environment. Some of these are fundamental
constraints on the web as a platform; some are known issues with
PyScript and Pyodide as runtime environments. You shouldn't expect that
arbitrary third-party Python packages will "just run" in a web
environment.

## Icon format

Web projects use a single 32px `.png` format icon as the site icon.

Web projects do not support splash screens or installer images.

## Additional options

The following options can be provided at the command line when producing
web projects:

### run

#### `--host <ip or hostname>`

The hostname or IP address that the development web server should be
bound to. Defaults to `localhost`.

#### `-p <port>` / `--port <port>`

The port that the development web server should be bound to. Defaults to
`8080`. If port `8080` is already in use, an arbitrary available port
will be used.

#### `--no-browser`

Don't open a web browser after starting the development web server.

## Application configuration

### `web`

The following options can be added to the
`tool.briefcase.app.<appname>.web` section of your `pyproject.toml`
file:

### `extra_pyscript_toml_content`

Any additional configuration that you wish to add to the `pyscript.toml`
file for your deployed site. For example, you can use this to change the
runtime used by Briefcase when deploying your site.

[`extra_pyscript_toml_content`][] is a string
that defines valid TOML content; this content will be parsed, and used
to add values to the `pyscript.toml` generated by Briefcase, overriding
any pre-existing keys. For example, to define a custom runtime, and
change the default PyScript app name, you could use:

```toml
extra_pyscript_toml_content = """
name = "My name override"

[[runtimes]]
src = "https://example.com/custom/pyodide.js"
"""
```
