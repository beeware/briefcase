# Tutorial

Briefcase is a packaging tool - but first you need something to package.
The best way to learn about Briefcase is to see it working with the rest
of the BeeWare suite of tools.

[The BeeWare tutorial](https://docs.beeware.org/en/latest/) walks you
through the process of building a native Python application from
scratch.

Once you've done that tutorial, the `Briefcase How-To Guides
<../how-to/index>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} provide details on
performing specific tasks with Briefcase.
