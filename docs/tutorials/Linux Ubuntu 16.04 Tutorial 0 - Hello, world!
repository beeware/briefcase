Linux Ubuntu 16.04 Tutorial 0 - Hello, world!
===============================================

In this tutorial, you'll take a really simple "Hello, world!" program written in
Python, convert it into a working Ubuntu Linux project.

Setup
-----

This tutorial assumes you've read and followed the instructions in
:doc:`/intro/getting-started`. This Tutorial is for Linux Users developing for Ubuntu 16.04!
* A ``tutorial`` directory,
* A activated Python 3 virtual environment,
* Briefcase installed in that virtual environment,

Start a new project
-------------------

Let's get started by using `the handy template <https://github.com/pybee/briefcase-template>`_ ``briefcase-template``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install cookiecutter briefcase
    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/pybee/briefcase-template

This will ask a bunch of questions of you. We'll use an `app_name` of "tutorial_0", and a 
`formal_name` of "Tutorial 0". Set the other values as you like

You'll now have a few files in this folder, including ``tutorial_0``. 

Check out what the provided ``tutorial_0/app.py`` file contains:

.. code-block:: bash

    (BeeWare)user$ cd tutorial_0
    (BeeWare)user$ cat tutorial_0/app.py

.. code-block:: python

    def main():
        # This needs to return an object that has a main_loop() method.
        return None

This won't do much as it is, but we can make it useful. 

Add this into the ``app.py`` to make it useful:

.. code-block:: python
    import __main__
    class MyApp:
        def main_loop(self):
            print("Hello world")
            
            
    def main():
        return MyApp()  

Create an Linux Ubuntu project
---------------------

It is all ready for using ``briefcase``. You can invoke it, using:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python setup.py linux

to create the Linux Ubuntu app.

Open the project 
-------------------------------

There is a new folder in your project called 'linux', which contains the project (tutorial_0). You can open the application by running:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./linux/tutorial_0

The app should run like this!
.. code-block:: bash

    (BeeWare) ry@X1Carbon:~/Native/tutorial_0$ ./linux/tutorial_0
    Hello World!
   
And that is all, you created your first Ubuntu Linux python app!
