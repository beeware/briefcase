Setting up your development environment
---------------------------------------

The recommended way of setting up your development envrionment for Briefcase is
to install a `virtual environment
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`, install the required
dependencies and start coding. Assuming that you are using
``virtualenvwrapper``, you only have to run::

    $ git clone git@github.com:beeware/briefcase.git
    $ cd briefcase
    $ python3 -m venv venv
    $ . venv/bin/activate  # For Windows CMD: venv\Scripts\activate

Briefcase uses ``unittest`` (or ``unittest2`` for Python < 2.7) for its own test
suite as well as additional helper modules for testing. To install all the
requirements for Briefcase, you have to run the following commands within your
virutal envrionment::

    $ (venv) pip install -e .  # for Windows CMD: pip install -e cd

Now you are ready to start hacking! Have fun!
