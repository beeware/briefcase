Debug via VS Code
=================

Debugging is possible at different stages in your development process. It is
different to debug a development app via ``briefcase dev`` than a bundled app
that is built via ``briefcase build`` and run via ``briefcase run``.

Development
-----------
During development on your host system you should use ``briefcase dev``. To
attach the VS Code debugger you have to create a configuration in your
``.vscode/launch.json`` file like this:

.. code-block:: JSON

    {
        "version": "0.2.0",
        "configurations": [
            {
                "name": "Briefcase: Dev",
                "type": "debugpy",
                "request": "launch",
                "module": "briefcase",
                "args": [
                    "dev",
                ],
                "justMyCode": false
            },
        ]
    }

To start a debug session, open the debug view in VS Code using the sidebar, select the
"Briefcase: Dev" configuration and press ``Start Debugging (F5)``. That will run
``briefcase dev`` in a debug session.

For more details about the VS Code configurations in the ``.vscode/launch.json`` file
see the `VS Code documentation <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/debugging>`_.

Bundled App
-----------
It is also possible to debug a bundled app. This is currently still an
**experimental feature** that is only supported on Windows and macOS.

To debug a bundled app a piece of the debugger has to be embedded into your app.
This is done via:

.. code-block:: console

    $ briefcase build --debug debugpy

This will build your app in debug mode and add `debugpy <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/debugtest/debugging#_debug-console-repl>`_
together with a package that automatically starts ``debugpy`` at the startup of
your bundled app.

Then it is time to run your app. You can do this via:

.. code-block:: console

    $ briefcase run --debug debugpy

Running the app in debug mode will automatically start the ``debugpy`` debugger
and listen for incoming connections. By default it will listen on ``localhost``
and port ``5678``. You can then connect your VS Code debugger to the app by
creating a configuration like this in the ``.vscode/launch.json`` file:

.. code-block:: JSON

    {
        "version": "0.2.0",
        "configurations": [
            {
                "name": "Briefcase: Attach",
                "type": "debugpy",
                "request": "attach",
                "connect": {
                    "host": "localhost",
                    "port": 5678
                }
                "justMyCode": false
            }
        ]
    }

The app will not start until you attach the debugger. Once you attach the
VS Code debugger, you can set `breakpoints <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/debugtest/debugging#_breakpoints>`_,
use the `data inspection <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/debugtest/debugging#_data-inspection>`_,
use the `debug console REPL <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/debugtest/debugging#_debug-console-repl>`_
and all other debugging features of VS Code.

But there are some restrictions that must be taken into account:

- Restart your application via the green circle is not working. You have to stop
  the app manually and start it again via ``briefcase run --debug debugpy``.
- ``justMyCode`` has to be set to ``false``. When setting it to ``true``, or not
  defining it at all, breakpoints are missed on some platforms (e.g., Windows).
  The reason for this is currently unknown.
- ``pathMappings`` should not be set manually in the ``launch.json``. The path
  mappings will be set by Briefcase programmatically and if setting it manually
  too the manual setting will overwrite settings by Briefcase.
