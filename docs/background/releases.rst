0.3.16 (2023-10-20)
===================

Features
--------

* Support for less common environments, such as Linux on ARM, has been improved. Error messages for unsupported platforms are now more accurate. (`#1360 <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1360>`__)
* Tool verification for Java, Android SDK, and WiX have been improved to provide more informative errors and debug logging. (`#1382 <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1382>`__)
* A super verbose logging mode was added (enabled using ``-vv``). This turns on all Briefcase internal logging, but also enables verbose logging for all the third-party tools that Briefcase invokes. (`#1384 <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1384>`__)
* Briefcase now uses Android SDK Command-Line Tools v9.0. If an externally-managed Android SDK is being used, it must provide this version of Command-Line Tools. Use the SDK Manager in Android Studio to ensure it is installed. (`#1397 <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1397>`__)
* Support for OpenSuSE Linux distributions was added. (`#1416 <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1416>`__)
* iOS apps are no longer rejected by the iOS App Store for packaging reasons. (`#1439 <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1439>`__)
* The Java JDK version was upgraded to 17.0.8.1+1. (`#1462 <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1462>`__)
* macOS apps can now be configured to produce single platform binaries, or binaries that will work on both x86_64 and ARM64. (`#1482 <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1482>`__)


Bugfixes
--------

* Build warnings caused by bugs in Xcode that can be safely ignored are now filtered out of visible output. (`#377 <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/377>`__)
* The run command now ensures Android logging is shown when the datetime on the device is different from the host machine. (`#1146 <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1146>`__)
* Briefcase will detect if you attempt to launch an Android app on a device whose OS doesn't meet minimum version requirements. (`#1157 <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1157>`__)
* macOS apps are now guaranteed to be universal binaries, even when dependencies only provide single-architecture binary wheels. (`#1217 <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1217>`__)
* The ability to build AppImages in Docker on macOS was restored. (`#1352 <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1352>`__)
* Error reporting has been improved when the target Docker image name is invalid. (`#1368 <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1368>`__)
* Creating Debian packages no longer fails due to a permission error for certain ``umask`` values (such as ``0077``). (`#1369 <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1369>`__)
* Inside of Docker containers, the Briefcase data directory is now mounted at ``/briefcase`` instead of ``/home/brutus/.cache/briefcase``. (`#1374 <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1374>`__)
* The console output from invoking Python via a subprocess call is now properly decoded as UTF-8. (`#1407 <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1407>`__)
* The command line arguments used to configure the Python environment for ``briefcase dev`` no longer leak into the runtime environment on macOS. (`#1413 <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1413>`__)


Backward Incompatible Changes
-----------------------------

* AppImage packaging requires a recent release of LinuxDeploy to continue creating AppImages. Run ``briefcase upgrade linuxdeploy`` to install the latest version. (`#1361 <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1361>`__)
* The size of iOS splash images have changed. iOS apps should now provide 800px, 1600px and 2400px images (previously, this as 1024px, 2048px and 3072px). This is because iOS 14 added a hard limit on the size of image resources. (`#1371 <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1371>`__)
* Support for AppImage has been reduced to "best effort". We will maintain unit test coverage for the AppImage backend, but we no longer build AppImages as part of our release process. We will accept bug reports related to AppImage support, and we will merge PRs that address AppImage support, but the core team no longer considers addressing AppImage bugs a priority, and discourages the use of AppImage for new projects. (`#1449 <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1449>`__)


Documentation
-------------

* Documentation on the process of retrieving certificate identities on macOS and Windows was improved. (`#1473 <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1473>`__)

0.3.15 (2023-07-10)
===================

Features
--------

* Windows apps can now be packaged as simple ZIP files. (`#457 <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/457>`__)
* An Android SDK specified in ``ANDROID_HOME`` is respected now and will take precedence over the setting of ``ANDROID_SDK_ROOT``. (`#463 <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/463>`__)
* Android support was upgraded to use Java 17 for builds. (`#1065 <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1065>`__)

Bugfixes
--------

* XML compatibility warnings generated by the Android build have been cleaned up. (`#827 <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/827>`__)
* Non ASCII characters provided in the ``briefcase new`` wizard are quoted before being put into ``pyproject.toml``. (`#1011 <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1011>`__)
* Requests to the web server are now recorded in the log file. (`#1090 <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1090>`__)
* An "Invalid Keystore format" error is no longer raised when signing an app if the local Android keystore was generated with a recent version of Java. (`#1112 <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1112>`__)
* Content before a closing square bracket (``]``) or ``.so)`` is no longer stripped by the macOS and iOS log filter. (`#1179 <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1179>`__)
* The option to run Linux system packages through Docker was removed. (`#1207 <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1207>`__)

* When creating a new Briefcase project, the header line in ``pyproject.toml`` now contains the version of Briefcase instead of "Unknown". (`#1276 <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1276>`__)
* Android logs no longer include timestamp and PID, making them easier to read on narrow screens. (`#1286 <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1286>`__)
* An warning is no longer logged if the Java identified by macOS is not usable by Briefcase. (`#1305 <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1305>`__)
* Incompatibilities with Cookiecutter 2.2.0 have been resolved. (`#1347 <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1347>`__)

Backward Incompatible Changes
-----------------------------

* Names matching modules in the Python standard library, and ``main``, can no longer be used as an application name. (`#853 <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/853>`__)
* The ``--no-sign`` option for packaging was removed. Briefcase will now prompt for a signing identity during packaging, falling back to adhoc/no signing as a default where possible. (`#865 <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/865>`__)
* The version of OpenJDK for Java was updated from 8 to 17. Any Android apps generated on previous versions of Briefcase must be re-generated by running ``briefcase create android gradle``. If customizations were made to files within the generated app, they will need to be manually re-applied after re-running the create command. (`#1065 <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1065>`__)
* Flatpak apps no longer default to using the Freedesktop runtime and SDK version 21.08 when a runtime is not specified. Instead, the runtime now must be explicitly defined in the `application configuration <https://briefcase.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/platforms/linux/flatpak.html#application-configuration>`__. (`#1272 <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1272>`__)

--------

* iOS and Android now supports the installation of binary packages. (#471)
* Apps can now selectively remove files from the final app bundle using the ``cleanup_paths`` attribute. (#550)
* The Docker image for AppImage builds is created or updated for all commands instead of just ``create``. (#796)
* The performance of Briefcase's tool verification process has been improved. (#801)
* Briefcase templates are now versioned by the Briefcase version, rather than the Python version. (#824)
* Android commands now start faster, as they only gather a list of SDK packages when needed to write a log file. (#832)
* Log messages can be captured on iOS if they originate from a dynamically loaded module. (#842)
* Added an "open" command that can be used to open projects in IDEs. (#846)

Bugfixes
--------

* The Wait Bar is disabled for batch scripts on Windows to prevent hiding user prompts when CTRL+C is pressed. (#811)
* Android emulators that don't provide a model identifier can now be used to launch apps. (#820)
* All ``linuxdeploy`` plugins are made executable and ELF headers for AppImage plugins are patched for use in ``Docker``. (#829)
* The RCEdit plugin can now be upgraded. (#837)
* When verifying the existence of the Android emulator, Briefcase now looks for the actual binary, not the folder
  that contains the binary. This was causing false positives on some Android SDK setups. (#841)

0.3.9 (2022-08-17)
==================

Features
--------

* Linux apps can now be packaged in Flatpak format. (#359)
* SDKs, tools, and other downloads needed to support app builds are now stored in an OS-native user cache directory instead of ``~/.briefcase``. (#374)

* Temporary docker containers are now cleaned up after use. The wording of Docker progress messages has also been improved. (#774)
* Users can now define a ``BRIEFCASE_HOME`` environment variable. This allows you to specify the location of the Briefcase tool cache, allowing the user to avoid issues with spaces in paths or disk space limitations. (#789)
* Android emulator output is now printed to the console if it fails to start properly. (#799)
* ``briefcase android run`` now shows logs from only the current process, and includes all log tags except some particularly noisy and useless ones. It also no longer clears the ``logcat`` buffer. (#814)


Bugfixes
--------

* Apps now have better isolation against the current working directory. This ensures that code in the current working directory isn't inadvertently included when an app runs. (#662)
* Windows MSI installers now install in ``Program Files``, rather than ``Program Files (x86)``. (#688)
* Linuxdeploy plugins can now be used when building Linux AppImages; this resolves many issues with GTK app deployment. (#756)

* A verbose log is written to file when a critical error occurs or --log is specified. (#760)

Bugfixes
--------

* Updating an Android app now forces a re-install of the app. This corrects a problem (usually seen on physical devices) where app updates wouldn't be deployed if the app was already on the device. (#395)
* The iOS simulator is now able to correctly detect the iOS version when only a device name is provided. (#528)
* Windows MSI projects are now able to support files with non-ASCII filenames. (#749)
* The existence of an appropriate Android system image is now verified independently to the existence of the emulator. (#762)
* The error message presented when the Xcode Command Line Tools are installed, but Xcode is not, has been clarified. (#763)
* The METADATA file generated by Briefcase is now UTF-8 encoded, so it can handle non-Latin-1 characters. (#767)
* Output from subprocesses is correctly encoded, avoiding errors (especially on Windows) when tool output includes non-ASCII content. (#770)

* macOS app binaries are now adhoc signed by default, ensuring they can run on M1 hardware. (#664)
* Xcode version checks are now more robust. (#668)
* Android projects that have punctuation in their formal names can now build without error. (#696)
* Bundle name validation no longer excludes valid country identifiers (like ``in.example``). (#709)
* Application code and dist-info is now fully replaced during an update. (#720)
* Errors related to Java JDK detection now properly contain the value of JAVA_HOME instead of the word None (#727)
* All log entries will now be displayed for the run command on iOS and macOS; previously, initial log entries may have been omitted. (#731)

==================

Features
--------

* macOS projects can now be generated as an Xcode project. (#523)

Misc
----

* #428


0.3.1 (2020-06-13)
==================

Features
--------

* The Linux AppImage backend has been modified to use Docker. This ensures that the AppImage is always built in an environment that is compatible with the support package. It also enables Linux AppImages to be built on macOS and Windows. "Native" builds (i.e., builds that *don't* use Docker) can be invoked using the ``--no-docker`` argument. (#344)
* A ``PYTHONPATH`` property has been added to ``AppConfig`` that describes the ``sys.path`` changes needed to run the app. (#401)
* Ad-hoc code signing is now possible on macOS with ``briefcase package --adhoc-sign``. (#409)
* Android apps can now use use ``-`` in their bundle name; we now convert ``-`` to ``_`` in the resulting Android package identifier and Java package name. (#415)
* Mobile applications now support setting the background color of the splash screen, and setting a build identifier. (#422)
* Android now has a ``package`` command that produces the release APK. After manually signing this APK, it can be published to the Google Play Store. (#423)

* An explicit version check for Docker is now performed. (#402)
* The Linux build process ensures the Docker user matches the UID/GID of the host user. (#403)
* Briefcase now ensures that the Python installation ecosystem tools (``pip``, ``setuptools``, and ``wheel``), are all present and up to date. (#421)

Improved Documentation
----------------------

* Documented that Windows MSI builds produce per-user installable MSI installers, while still supporting per-machine installs via the CLI. (#382)
* ``CONTRIBUTING.md`` has been updated to link to Briefcase-specific documentation. (#404)
* Removed references to the ``build-system`` table in ``pyproject.toml``. (#410)

Misc
----

* #380, #384
