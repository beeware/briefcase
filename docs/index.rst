Briefcase
=========

Briefcase is a tool for converting a Python project into a standalone
native application. It supports producing binaries for:

* macOS, as a standalone .app
* Windows, as an MSI installer
* Linux, as a native system package
* iOS, as an Xcode project
* Android, as a Gradle project
* the Web, as a static web site using PyScript for client-side Python

It is also extensible, allowing for additional platforms and installation
formats to be produced.
