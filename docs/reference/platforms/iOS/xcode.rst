When generating an iOS project, Briefcase produces an Xcode project.

Icon format
===========

iOS projects use ``.png`` format icons. An application must provide icons of
the following sizes:

* 20px
* 29px
* 40px
* 58px
* 60px
* 76px
* 80px
* 87px
* 120px
* 152px
* 167px
* 180px
* 1024px

Splash Image format
===================

iOS projects use ``.png`` format splash screen images. A splash screen should
be a square, transparent image, provided in the following sizes:

* 800px
* 1600px
* 2400px

You can specify a background color for the splash screen using the
``splash_background_color`` configuration setting.

iOS projects do not support installer images.

Additional options
==================

The following options can be provided at the command line when producing
iOS projects:

run
---

``-d <device>`` / ``--device <device>``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The device simulator to target. Can be either a UDID, a device name (e.g.,
``"iPhone 11"``), or a device name and OS version (``"iPhone 11::iOS 13.3"``).

Platform quirks
===============

.. _ios-third-party-packages:

Availability of third-party packages
------------------------------------

Briefcase is able to use third-party packages in iOS apps. As long as the package is
available on PyPI, or you can provide a wheel file for the package, it can be added to
the ``requires`` declaration in your ``pyproject.toml`` file and used by your app at
runtime.

If the package is pure Python (i.e., it does not contain a binary library), that's all
you need to do. To check whether a package is pure Python, look at the PyPI downloads
page for the project; if the wheels provided are have a ``-py3-none-any.whl`` suffix,
then they are pure Python wheels. If the wheels have version and platform-specific
extensions (e.g., ``-cp311-cp311-macosx_11_0_universal2.whl``), then the wheel contains
a binary component.

If the package contains a binary component, that wheel needs to be compiled for iOS.
PyPI does not currently support uploading iOS-compatible wheels, so you can't rely on
PyPI to provide those wheels. Briefcase uses a `secondary repository
<https://anaconda.org/beeware/repo>`__ to store pre-compiled iOS wheels.

This repository is maintained by the BeeWare project, and as a result, it does not have
binary wheels for *every* package that is available on PyPI, or even every *version* of
every package that is on PyPI. If you see any of the following messages when building an
app for a mobile platform, then the package (or this version of it) probably isn't
supported yet:

* The error "Cannot compile native modules"
* A reference to downloading a ``.tar.gz`` version of the package
* A reference to ``Building wheels for collected packages: <package>``

It is *usually* possible to compile any binary package wheels for iOS, depending on the
requirements of the package itself. If the package has a dependency on other binary
libraries (e.g., something like ``libjpeg`` that isn't written in Python), those
libraries will need to be compiled for iOS as well. However, if the library requires
build tools that don't support iOS, such as a compiler that can't target iOS, or a
PEP517 build system that doesn't support cross-compilation, it may not be possible to
build an iOS wheel.

The BeeWare Project provides the `Mobile Forge
<https://github.com/beeware/mobile-forge>`__ project to assist with cross-compiling iOS
binary wheels. This repository contains recipes for building the packages that are
stored in the `secondary package repository <https://anaconda.org/beeware/repo>`__.
Contributions of new package recipes are welcome, and can be submitted as pull requests.
Or, if you have a particular package that you'd like us to support, please visit the
`issue tracker <https://github.com/beeware/mobile-forge/issues>`__ and provide details
about that package.
