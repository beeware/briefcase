package
=======

Compile/build an application installer. By default, targets the current
platform's default output format.

This will produce an installable artefact.

.. admonition:: Packaging tool dependencies

    Building installers for some platforms depends on the build tools for the
    platform you're targetting being available on the platform you're using.
    For example, you will only be able to create iOS applications on macOS.
    Briefcase will check for any required tools, and will report an error if
    the platform you're targetting is not supported.
