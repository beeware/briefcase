===
run
===

Starts the application, using the packaged version of the application code.
By default, targets the current platform's default output format.

If the output format is an executable (e.g., a macOS .app file), the ``run``
command will start that executable. If the output is an installer, ``run`` will
attempt to replicate as much as possible of the runtime environment that would
be installed, but will not actually install the app. For example, on Windows,
``run`` will use the interpreter that will be included in the installer, and
the versions of code and requirements that will be installed, but *won't* run
the installer to produce Start Menu items, registry records, etc.

Test mode
---------

The ``run`` command can also be used to execute your app's test suite, in the
packaged environment (e.g., on the iOS simulator, or from within a Linux
Flatpak). When running in test mode (using the ``--test`` option), a different
entry point will be used for the app: if your app is contained in a Python
module named ``myapp``, test mode will attempt to launch ``tests.myapp``. Your
app is responsible for providing the logic to discover and start the test suite.

The code for your test suite can specified using the ``test_sources`` setting;
test-specific requirements can be specified with ``test_requires``. Test sources
and requirements will only be included in your app when running in test mode.

Briefcase will monitor the log output of the test suite, looking for the output
corresponding to test suite completion. Briefcase has built-in support for
`pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest>`__ and `unittest
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html>`__ test suites; support for
other test frameworks can be added using the ``test_success_regex`` and
``test_failure_regex`` settings.

Usage
=====

To run your application on the current platform's default output format:

.. code-block:: console

    $ briefcase run

To run your application for a different platform:

.. code-block:: console

    $ briefcase run <platform>

To run your application using a specific output format:

.. code-block:: console

    $ briefcase run <platform> <output format>

Options
=======

The following options can be provided at the command line.

``-a <app name>`` / ``--app <app name``
---------------------------------------

Run a specific application target in your project. This argument is only
required if your project contains more than one application target. The app
name specified should be the machine-readable package name for the app.

``-u`` / ``--update``
---------------------

Update the application's source code before running. Equivalent to running:

.. code-block:: console

    $ briefcase update
    $ briefcase build
    $ briefcase run

``-r`` / ``--update-requirements``
----------------------------------

Update application requirements before running. Equivalent to running:

.. code-block:: console

    $ briefcase update -r
    $ briefcase build
    $ briefcase run

``--update-resources``
----------------------

Update application resources (e.g., icons and splash screens) before running.
Equivalent to running:

.. code-block:: console

    $ briefcase update --update-resources
    $ briefcase build
    $ briefcase run

``--test``
----------

Run the app in test mode in the bundled app environment. Running ``run --test``
will also cause an update and build to ensure that the packaged application
contains the most recent test code. To prevent this update and build, use the
``--no-update`` option.

``--no-update``
---------------

Prevent the automated update and build of app code that is performed when
specifying by the ``--test`` option.

Passthrough arguments
---------------------

If you want to pass any arguments to your app's command line, you can specify them
using the ``--`` marker to separate Briefcase's arguments from your app's arguments.
For example:

.. code-block:: console

    briefcase run -- --wiggle --test

will run the app in normal mode, passing the ``--wiggle`` and ``--test`` flags to
the app's command line. The app will *not* run in *Briefcase's* test mode; the
``--test`` flag will be left for your own app to interpret.
