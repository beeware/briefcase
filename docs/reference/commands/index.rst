Common options
==============

The following options are available to all commands:

``-h`` / ``--help``
-------------------

Display the available options for the command, and a description of usage.

``--log``
---------

Always generate a log file. A log file will *always* be generated if Briefcase doesn't
exit normally; however, it can sometimes be useful to generate a log file when a command
has succeeded unsuccessfully. The log file will always contain debug level output,
regardless of the ``-v`` / ``--verbosity`` option specified.

``--no-input``
--------------

Do not ask the user for input, and use default values. If a safe default behavior
exists, that default will be used; otherwise, the command will raise an error.

``-v`` / ``--verbosity``
------------------------

The verbosity of output generated by Briefcase. ``-v`` can be specified multiple times
to increase the verbosity:

* If no flag is specified, Briefcase will generate **default** output - enough detail to see
  that progress in a build is being made without being overwhelming.
* ``-v`` generates **verbose** output. For example, if a command processes a list of
  files, "normal" verbosity will show a progress bar as those files are processed, but
  verbose mode will output the name of each file being modified.
* ``-vv`` generates **debug** output. This will output more internal details of
  Briefcase operation. This includes the command line, environment, output and return
  value of every tool and command that Briefcase executes as part of a build.
* ``-vvv`` generates **deep debug** output. This will include the verbose output of
  all commands that Briefcase has invoked.

``-V`` / ``--version``
----------------------

Print the version of Briefcase being used.
