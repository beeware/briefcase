Briefcase can no longer install pure Python iOS packages from a source archive (i.e., a ``.tar.gz`` file published on PyPI). If a package is pure Python, it *must* be provided as a ``py3-none-any`` wheel. Briefcase's `iOS platform documentation <https://briefcase.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/platforms/iOS/xcode.html#requirements-cannot-be-provided-as-source-tarballs>`__ contains details on how to provide a ``py3-none-any`` wheel when PyPI does not provide one.
