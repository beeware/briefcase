New Toga projects now enforce an upper version bound of ``pygobject < 3.52.1``. PyGObject 3.52.1 introduced a system requirement of ``libgirepository-2.0-dev``; that library isn't available on Debian 12 or Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. If you have a project that isn't targeting those platforms, you can likely remove this pin.
