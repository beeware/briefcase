Added to ``briefcase run android`` a ``--no-streaming`` option which makes ``adb install`` run in no-streaming mode. ADB can install an app either directly from the host ("streamed install") or by copying the APK to the device and then running the installation process ("no-streaming"). The former is the current default, but the latter has to be specified for installation to work in some devices, for example those running recent versions of LineageOS.
