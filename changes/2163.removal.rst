Briefcase can no longer install pure Python macOS packages from a source archive (i.e., a ``.tar.gz`` file published on PyPI). If a package is pure Python, it *must* be provided as a ``py3-none-any`` wheel. Briefcase's `macOS platform documentation <https://briefcase.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/platforms/macOS/index.html>`__ contains details on how to provide a ``py3-none-any`` wheel when PyPI does not provide one.
