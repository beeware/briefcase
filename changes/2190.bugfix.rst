New apps using Toga on Linux will impose an upper version pin on PyGObject, limiting that package to ``< 3.52.1``. This is required to ensure that older Debian-based distributions are supported by default. This pin can be removed if these support for these distributions is not required, as long as some additional changes are made to the ``system_requires`` and ``system_runtime_requires`` definitions. The required changes are included (commented out) as part of the new project template.
