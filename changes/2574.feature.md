When a project defines multiple applications, `briefcase dev`and `briefcase run` now display an interactive menu allowing the user to select which application to start. In non-interactive mode (`--no-input`), both commands (`briefcase dev` and `briefcase run`) still raise a`BriefcaseCommandError` if multiple apps are defined and no `--app` option is given.
