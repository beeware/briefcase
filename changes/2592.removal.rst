Runtime requirements for Debian apps using PySide6 have been simplified. If you have an existing project, it may be possible to simplify your runtime requirements to only include `libgl1`, `libqt6dbus6`, `libqt6gui6`, and `libxcb-cursor0`. To support Ubuntu 22.04, you will also need to include `libxcb-icccm4`, `libxcb-keysyms1`, `libxcb-shape0` and `libxkbcommon-x11-0`.
